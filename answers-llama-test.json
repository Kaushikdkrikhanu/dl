        "The midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide, so the midpoint of the line segment joining $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ is also the midpoint of the line segment joining the other two vertices of the rectangle. The $y$-coordinate of a midpoint equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the two endpoints. Therefore, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices.  Since the sum is twice the average, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices is the same as that of the given vertices: $17+(-4)=\\boxed{13}$.",

        "Let the values on one pair of opposite faces be $a$ and $d$; the second pair of faces, $b$ and $e$, and the third pair of faces, $c$ and $f$. There are eight vertices on the cube, so we find that the sum 1001 is equal to $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def.$$ For any two faces adjacent at a vertex with $a$, the same two faces are adjacent to a vertex with $d$. Furthermore, any three adjacent faces must contain one of $a$ or $d$. Therefore, every term contains $a$ or $d$, and the expression is symmetric in $a$ and $d$. Considering the expression as a polynomial in $a$ (with the remaining variables fixed), we observe that $P(-d)=0$. Therefore, $a+d$ divides the given expression. Similarly, $b+e$ and $c+f$ divide the given expression as well. Therefore, $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def = k(a+d)(b+e)(c+f).$$ Here, since both sides are of degree three in their variables, $k$ must be a constant, which is easily seen to be $1$.\n\nIt follows that $(a+d)(b+e)(c+f) = 1001 = 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.

The ball is caught when it reached the high point after hitting the ground for the third time. To the nearest meter, how far has it travelled?assistant\n\nTo find the total distance traveled by the ball, we need to consider the distance it traveled downwards and the distance it traveled upwards.\n\nThe initial distance traveled downwards is 16 meters.\n\nOn the first bounce, it rises to a height of $\\frac34 \\times 16 = 12$ meters and then falls back down the same distance. So, the distance traveled upwards and downwards on the first bounce is 2 x 12 = 24 meters.\n\nOn the second bounce, it rises to a height of $\\frac34 \\times 12 = 9$ meters and then falls back down the same distance. So, the distance traveled upwards and downwards on the second bounce is 2 x 9 = 18 meters.\n\nOn the third bounce, it rises to a height of $\\frac34 \\times 9 = 6.75$ meters. Since the ball is caught at the high point, we only need to consider the distance it traveled upwards on the third bounce.\n\nThe total distance traveled by the ball is the sum of the initial distance, the distance traveled on the first bounce, the distance traveled on the second bounce, and the distance traveled on the third bounce. \n\nTotal distance = 16 + 24 + 18 + 6.75\nTotal distance = 64.75\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the total distance traveled by the ball is 65 meters.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 65.",

What number does she subtract?assistant\n\nTo calculate $31^2$, Emily uses the identity $(a + 1)^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1$, which simplifies to $a^2 + 2a + 1$. Here, $a = 30$. So, we can express $31^2$ as $(30 + 1)^2 = 30^2 + 2 \\cdot 30 + 1 = 30^2 + 61$. This is why she adds 61.\n\nTo calculate $29^2$, Emily uses the identity $(a - 1)^2 = a^2 - 2a + 1$, which simplifies to $a^2 - 2a + 1$. Here, $a = 30$. So, we can express $29^2$ as $(30 - 1)^2 = 30^2 - 2 \\cdot 30 + 1 = 30^2 - 60 + 1 = 30^2 - 59$. This is why she subtracts 59.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 59.",

What are the coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph?assistant\n\nTo find the minimum point of the new graph, we first need to find the minimum point of the original graph. The equation of the original graph is $y = |x| - 3$. The minimum point of this graph is when $x = 0$, which gives $y = -3$. So, the minimum point of the original graph is $(0, -3)$.\n\nNow, we need to translate this point two units to the left and three units down. To do this, we subtract 2 from the x-coordinate and subtract 3 from the y-coordinate. So, the new coordinates are $(0 - 2, -3 - 3) = (-2, -6)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(-2, -6)}$.",

To the nearest meter, how far has it travelled?assistant\n\nTo find the total distance traveled by the ball, we need to consider the distance it traveled downwards and the distance it traveled upwards.\n\nThe initial distance traveled downwards is 16 meters.\n\nOn the first bounce, it rises to a height of $\\frac34 \\times 16 = 12$ meters and then falls back down the same distance. So, the distance traveled upwards and downwards on the first bounce is 2 x 12 = 24 meters.\n\nOn the second bounce, it rises to a height of $\\frac34 \\times 12 = 9$ meters and then falls back down the same distance. So, the distance traveled upwards and downwards on the second bounce is 2 x 9 = 18 meters.\n\nOn the third bounce, it rises to a height of $\\frac34 \\times 9 = 6.75$ meters. Since the ball is caught at the high point, we only need to consider the distance it traveled upwards on the third bounce.\n\nThe total distance traveled by the ball is the sum of the initial distance, the distance traveled on the first bounce, the distance traveled on the second bounce, and the distance traveled on the third bounce. \n\nTotal distance = 16 + 24 + 18 + 6.75\nTotal distance = 64.75\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the total distance traveled by the ball is 65 meters.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 65.user\n\nThere might be an error in the solution above because of lack of understanding of the question. Please correct the error, if any, and rewrite the solution. Only output the final solution!

What number does she subtract?assistant\n\nTo calculate $31^2$, Emily uses the identity $(a + 1)^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1$, which simplifies to $a^2 + 2a + 1$. Here, $a = 30$. So, we can express $31^2$ as $(30 + 1)^2 = 30^2 + 2 \\cdot 30 + 1 = 30^2 + 61$.

So, we can express $29^2$ as $(30 - 1)^2 = 30^2 - 2 \\cdot 30 + 1 = 30^2 - 60 + 1 = 30^2 - 59$.

However, to calculate $29^2$, Emily subtracts a number from $30^2$, which means we need to look at the negative difference, so $30^2 - 29^2 = 59$ becomes $29^2 = 30^2 - 59$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 59.",

What are the coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph?assistant\n\nTo find the minimum point of the new graph, we first need to find the minimum point of the original graph. The equation of the original graph is $y = |x| - 3$. The minimum point of this graph is when $x = 0$, which gives $y = -3$. So, the minimum point of the original graph is $(0, -3)$.\n\nNow, we need to translate this point two units to the left and three units down. To do this, we subtract 2 from the x-coordinate and subtract 3 from the y-coordinate. So, the new coordinates are $(0 - 2, -3 - 3) = (-2, -6)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(-2, -6)}$.user\n\nThere might be an error in the solution above because of lack of understanding of the question.

When this graph is translated two units to the left and three units down, the new minimum point will be $(-2, -6)$. However, the minimum point of the graph $y = |x| - 3$ is actually at $(0, -3)$ and this minimum point is a result of the absolute value function. When we translate this graph, the minimum point will shift to a point where the absolute value function is at its minimum after the translation. The absolute value function is at its minimum when $x = 0$, and after translating 2 units to the left, $x = -2$ will be the new point where the absolute value function is at its minimum. Since we are translating the graph 3 units down, the new minimum point will be $(-2, -6 - 3) = (-2, -9)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(-2, -9)}$.",

So, we must factor the equation by grouping by taking the common factor of $-3$ out of the last two terms.\n$$x^2 - 21x + 54 = x^2 - 18x - 3x + 54 = x(x - 18) - 3(x - 18).$$\nThis gives us the equation\n$$(x - 18)(x - 3) = 0.$$\nHowever, this is incorrect, because $(x - 3)$ is a common factor, so we must factor $x^2 - 21x + 54$ by grouping. \n$x^2 - 21x + 54$ can be rewritten as \n$$(x^2 - 18x) + (-3x + 54).$$\nWe can then factor by grouping\n$$(x^2 - 18x) + (-3x + 54) = x(x - 18) -3 (x - 18) = (x - 18)(x - 3).$$\nHowever, this is still incorrect, because the equation is equal to 0.
