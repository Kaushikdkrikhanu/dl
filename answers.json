        "We don't know $g(x)$, so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $25$ in to get an answer. We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) =x^2 + x + 1$.  So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $25$ is the resulting output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(25)$.\n\nIf $f(x) = 25$, then we have $3x^2 - 2 = 25$, so $x^2 = 9$, which means $x=3$ or $x=-3$.  Since $x$ could be $3$ or $-3$, we could have $g(25) = g(f(3))$ or $g(25) = g(f(-3))$.  Using the given expression for $g(f(x))$, the two possible values of $g(25)$ are  $g(f(3)) = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 13$ and $g(f(-3)) = (-3)^2 + (-3) + 1 = 7$.  The sum of these is $13+7=\\boxed{20}$.",

To solve the given problem, we start by expressing the given quadratic expression $16x^2-106x-105$ in the form $(8x + a)(2x + b)$.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form. The standard form of a circle's equation is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.\n\nThe given equation is $2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20$. We can rewrite this as $x^2 - y^2 + 6x - 2y + 10 = 0$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add and subtract $(3)^2$ for the $x$ terms and $(1)^2$ for the $y$ terms. This gives us $x^2 + 6x + 9 - 9 - y^2 - 2y + 1 = 0$, which simplifies to $(x+3)^2 - (y+1)^2 = 8$.\n\nRearranging, we get $(x+3)^2 = (y+1)^2 + 8$. This is the equation of a hyperbola, not a circle. However, since the circle is inscribed in a square, the circle must be tangent to the sides of the square. This means that the circle and the square share the same center.\n\nThe center of the circle is $(-3, -1)$. Since the circle is tangent to the sides of the square, the radius of the circle is equal to half the side length of the square.\n\nThe radius of the circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. We can find this by using the distance formula, which is $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.\n\nLet's find the distance from the center $(-3, -1)$ to the point $(0, 0)$ on the circle. This gives us $d = \\sqrt{(-3 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{10}$.\n\nSince the radius is half the side length of the square, the side length of the square is $2\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.

Therefore, we have:\n\n$2 < 3$ (which is true) and $2 > \\frac{a - 6}{3}$.\n\nSolving the second inequality for $a$, we get $a < 6 + 6 = 12$.\n\nSince $a$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $a$ are $1, 2, 3, ..., 11$.\n\nHowever, we need to check if $x = 2$ is the only solution for each of these values of $a$.\n\nFor $a = 1$, the second inequality becomes $3x - 1 > -6$, which simplifies to $x > \\frac{5}{3}$. Since $x = 2$ is an integer and satisfies this inequality, it is a solution. But we need to check if there are other solutions.

To solve the given problem, we start by rewriting the given equation in a more manageable form. The equation is:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34\\]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to group the $x$ and $y$ terms on one side, which gives us:\n\n\\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34\\]\n\nNext, we complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms. To do this, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$ and $y$ to their respective sides. For $x$, the coefficient is $10$, so we add and subtract $(10/2)^2 = 25$. For $y$, the coefficient is $6$, so we add and subtract $(6/2)^2 = 9$. This gives us:\n\n\\[x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 + 6y + 9 = -34 + 25 + 9\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 + 6y + 9 = 0\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0\\]\n\nSince a square of a real number is always non-negative, and the sum of two non-negative numbers is zero only if both numbers are zero, we have:\n\n\\[(x - 5)^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (y + 3)^2 = 0\\]\n\nSolving these equations gives us:\n\n\\[x - 5 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 5\\]\n\\[y + 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = -3\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of $x$ and $y$ is:\n\n\\[x + y = 5 + (-3) = 2\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{2}\\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$."

To solve the given problem, we start by expressing the given quadratic expression $16x^2-106x-105$ in the form $(8x + a)(2x + b)$. This can be expanded as follows:\n\n\\[\n(8x + a)(2x + b) = 16x^2 + (8b + 2a)x + ab\n\\]\n\nGiven that this expression is equal to $16x^2-106x-105$, we can equate the coefficients of the corresponding terms:\n\n\\[\n16x^2 + (8b + 2a)x + ab = 16x^2 - 106x - 105\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n8b + 2a &= -106 \\\\\nab &= -105\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for $a$ and $b$, we first simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:\n\n\\[\n4b + a = -53\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the system:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n4b + a &= -53 \\\\\nab &= -105\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express $a$ in terms of $b$:\n\n\\[\na = -53 - 4b\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives:\n\n\\[\n(-53 - 4b)b = -105\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging, we get:\n\n\\[\n4b^2 + 53b - 105 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $b$. Solving this equation, we find that $b = -5$ or $b = -3$. Substituting these values back into the equation for $a$, we find that $a = 13$ when $b = -5$ and $a = -19$ when $b = -3$.\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs You are a math expert.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form.

To do this, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$ and $y$ to their respective sides. For $x$, the coefficient is $10$, so we add and subtract $(10/2)^2 = 25$. For $y$, the coefficient is $6$, so we add and subtract $(6/2)^2 = 9$. This gives us:\n\n\\[x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 + 6y + 9 = -34 + 25 + 9\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 + 6y + 9 = 0\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0\\]\n\nSince a square of a real number is always non-negative, and the sum of two non-negative numbers is zero only if both numbers are zero, we have:\n\n\\[(x - 5)^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (y + 3)^2 = 0\\]\n\nSolving these equations gives us:\n\n\\[x - 5 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 5\\]\n\\[y + 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = -3\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of $x$ and $y$ is:\n\n\\[x + y = 5 + (-3) = 2\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{2}\\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.

Only output the final solution! At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form \"Final Answer: The final answer is $answer$. I hope it is correct.\" The given equation is $x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34$. To find $x+y$, we can rearrange the equation to group the $x$ and $y$ terms on one side:\n\n\\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34\\]\n\nNext, we complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms. To do this, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$ and $y$ to their respective sides. For $x$, the coefficient is $10$, so we add and subtract $(10/2)^2 = 25$. For $y$, the coefficient is $6$, so we add and subtract $(6/2)^2 = 9$.
