        "## Step 1: Define the problem and the variables\nLet's denote the number of dogs Denali walks as $D$, the number of dogs Nate walks as $N$, and the number of dogs in each group as $x$. We are given that $D = 16$ and $N = 12$. We also know that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is the same if Denali starts walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stays at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate the equation for the ratio of pay\nThe ratio of pay is given by $\\frac{16x}{12x} = \\frac{16}{12}$, since the number of dogs walked by Denali and Nate is proportional to their pay.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the ratio of pay\nSince the ratio of pay is the same in both cases, we can set up the equation $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{16x}{12x + kx}$, where $k$ is the number of dogs reassigned to Denali.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for k\nTo solve for $k$, we can cross-multiply: $16(12x + kx) = 12 \\cdot 16x$. This simplifies to $192x + 16kx = 192x$, and further simplifies to $16kx = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for k\nSolving for $k$ gives us $k = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute k into the equation and solve for x\nSubstituting $k = 0$ into the equation $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{16x}{12x + kx}$ gives us $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{16x}{12x}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation gives us $\\frac{4}{3} = 1$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for x\nHowever, we notice that the equation $\\frac{4}{3} = 1$ is not true. We made an error in our previous steps.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the equation\nRe-evaluating the equation $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{16x}{12x + kx}$ and substituting $k = 0$ into it gives us $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{16x}{12x}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation gives us $\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4x}{3x}$.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for x\nSimplifying the equation further gives us $\\frac{4}{3} = 1$.\n\n## Step 12: Realize the error in previous steps\nThe error in the previous steps was assuming that k = 0 would lead to a valid solution. However, we should have noticed that the initial equation $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{16x}{12x + kx}$ had a flaw when we substituted k = 0.\n\n## Step 13: Correct the mistake\nThe mistake was in assuming that substituting k = 0 would solve the equation. However, it does not. We should have noticed that the equation was always true regardless of the value of k.\n\n## Step 14: Correctly solve the equation\nThe correct solution is to realize that the ratio of pay is constant regardless of the number of dogs walked by Denali and Nate. This means that the ratio of pay is the same for any number of dogs walked by Denali and Nate.\n\n## Step 15: Solve for x\nSince the ratio of pay is the same for any number of dogs walked by Denali and Nate, we can set up the equation $\\frac{16x}{12x} = \\frac{16}{12}$. However, we realize that the initial equation was flawed and the correct approach is to analyze the situation without substituting k = 0.\n\n## Step 16: Analyze the situation without substituting k = 0\nThe situation can be analyzed by considering the ratio of pay for any number of dogs walked by Denali and Nate. We can see that the ratio of pay is constant and does not depend on the number of dogs walked.\n\n## Step 17: Realize that the initial equation was incorrect\nThe initial equation $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{16x}{12x + kx}$ was incorrect because it assumed that k = 0 would lead to a valid solution.\n\n## Step 18: Correctly analyze the situation\nWe should analyze the situation without assuming k = 0.

This gives us $(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x$.\nStep 4:  Expanding the left-hand side, we get $x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we obtain $x^2 - 6x - 5 = 0$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can factorize the quadratic equation to solve for $x$.

        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The worker starts with $\\$20,000$ and deposits it into the savings account at the end of each year. So, after the first year, the account has $\\$20,000 + \\$20,000 = \\$40,000$. \n\n2.

Since the worker wants to have at least $\\$66,200$ in the account by the end of the third year, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$$80,000(1 + r)^3 \\ge 66,200$$\n\n5. To solve for $r$, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $80,000$:\n\n$$(1 + r)^3 \\ge 66,200 / 80,000$$\n\n6. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:\n\n$$(1 + r)^3 \\ge 0.825$$\n\n7.

        "Step 1:  To find the number of ways $7$ people can sit around a round table with the restriction that no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other, we need to consider the total number of arrangements without this restriction and then subtract the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other.\n\nStep 2:  First, let's calculate the total number of arrangements for $7$ people around a round table. Since the table is round, we can fix one person's position as a reference point, and the remaining $6$ people can be arranged in $6!$ ways.\n\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the restriction that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas cannot sit next to each other. We can treat this restriction as placing these three people in the $7$ available seats around the table, which we can do in $4!$ ways (as there are $4$ seats where they can sit, and the order matters).\n\nStep 4:  After placing Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, we are left with $4$ seats for the remaining $4$ people. These can be arranged in $4!$ ways.\n\nStep 5:  Now, to find the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other, we treat them as a single block. This block, along with the $4$ remaining people, can be arranged in $5!$ ways.\n\nStep 6:  However, within the block of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, there are $3!$ ways to arrange them. So, the total number of arrangements where they sit next to each other is $5! \\times 3!$.\n\nStep 7:  Finally, to find the number of arrangements where no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other, we subtract the number of arrangements where they sit next to each other from the total number of arrangements.\n\nStep 8:  Therefore, the number of arrangements where no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other is $6! - 4! \\times 3!$.\n\nStep 9:  Evaluating this expression gives us the total number of valid arrangements.\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, the final answer is $6! - 4! \\times 3! = 720 - 24 \\times 6 = 720 - 144 = 576$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{576}$.",

        "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of soldiers that can be sent in each type of battalion. \n\nFor the upper class battalion, we have 4 soldiers. For the lower class battalion, we have 8 soldiers.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of battalions that can be sent. We know that there are 5 upper class soldiers and 10 lower class soldiers. We can represent this as an equation:\n\n5 (upper class soldiers) + 10 (lower class soldiers) = 4x + 8y\n\nWe also know that the total number of soldiers sent in each type of battalion must be a multiple of the number of soldiers in that type of battalion. \n\nSince the total number of upper class soldiers is 4, we can represent this as 4x. \n\nSimilarly, since the total number of lower class soldiers is 8, we can represent this as 8y.\n\nNow, let's find the possible values of x and y that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe know that 5 + 10 = 15. \n\nSince 15 must be a multiple of 4 and 8, we can try different values of x and y that satisfy these conditions.\n\nIf x = 3, then 4x = 12. \n\nIf y = 1, then 8y = 8. \n\nNow, we can find the total number of battalions that can be sent by

        "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the relevant concept\nTo find the constant term in the expansion of the given expression, we need to use the Binomial Theorem, which is a method for expanding expressions of the form $(a + b)^n$. The constant term arises when the powers of $x$ in the terms of the product cancel each other out.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Binomial Theorem\nAccording to the Binomial Theorem, the general term in the expansion of $(a + b)^n$ is given by $\\binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^r$, where $\\binom{n}{r}$ is the binomial coefficient. In this case, we have $a = 10x^3$, $b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}$, and $n = 5$. We are interested in finding the constant term, which occurs when the powers of $x$ in the terms of the product cancel each other out.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the values of r and n-r\nTo find the constant term, we need to determine the values of $r$ and $n-r$ such that the powers of $x$ cancel each other out. Since $a = 10x^3$ and $b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}$, we can see that the power of $x$ in $a$ is $3$ and the power of $x$ in $b$ is $-2$. To cancel out the power of $x$, we need to choose $r$ such that $3(5-r) - 2r = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for r\nSolving the equation $3(5-r) - 2r = 0$, we get $15 - 3r - 2r = 0$, which simplifies to $15 - 5r = 0$.

Therefore, we choose $r = 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the constant term\nNow that we have determined the value of $r$, we can calculate the constant term using the formula $\\binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^r$. Substituting $n = 5$, $r = 3$, $a = 10x^3$, and $b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}$, we get $\\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} (-\\frac{1}{2x^2})^3$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get $\\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 (-\\frac{1}{2x^2})^3 = \\binom{5}{3} 100x^6 \\frac{-1}{8x^6} = \\binom{5}{3} \\frac{-100}{8}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the binomial coefficient\nEvaluating the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{3}$, we get $\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression further\nSubstituting the value of the binomial coefficient, we get $10 \\times \\frac{-100}{8} = 10 \\times -\\frac{100}{8} = 10 \\times -\\frac{25}{2} = -\\frac{250}{2} = -125$.\n\n## Step 9: Write the final answer\nThe constant term in the expansion of the given expression is $-\\frac{250}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-125}$",

        "Step 1:  To find the distance from Bill's starting point to his final position, we need to understand the concept of vector addition and the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 2:  Let's consider Bill's starting point as the origin of a coordinate system, and his final position as his current location.\nStep 3:  Bill walks $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, which means he is now at a point $\\left(0, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 4:  Then, he walks $\\frac{3}{4}$ mile east, placing him at $\\left(0, -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\left(0, \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$.\nStep 5:  Finally, he walks $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, resulting in his final position being at $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(0, \\frac{3}{4}\\right)$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can treat Bill's final position as a right-angled triangle with the origin as the vertex opposite the hypotenuse.\nStep 7:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, which represents the direct line distance from Bill's starting point to his final position.\nStep 8:  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the two sides are $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ miles.\nStep 9:  So, we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse as $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2}$.\nStep 10:  Solving this, we get $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{8}}$.\nStep 11:  Finally, simplifying, we get $\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{8}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{4}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the distance from Bill's starting point to his final position is $\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{4}$ miles.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{4}}$.",
        "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nWe are given that $\\sin A = 2\\cos A$ in right triangle $ABC$ with $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the roots of the quadratic equation $y^2 + y + 1 = 0$.\nWe can rewrite $\\sqrt{-3}$ as $i\\sqrt{3}$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit. Therefore, the roots of the equation are $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute back $y = z^2$ to get the roots of the original equation $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$.\nThe roots of the original equation are given by $z^2 = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Take the square root of both sides of the equation to solve for $z$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $z = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Recognize that the roots of the equation $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ are the 12th roots of unity.\nThe roots of the equation are the 12th roots of unity, which include both real and complex roots.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of the equation $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity.\nSince the roots of the equation are the 12th roots of unity, the smallest positive integer $n$ is 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
        "## Step 1: Factor the denominator of the function to find the vertical asymptotes.\nTo find the vertical asymptotes, we need to factor the denominator of the function. The denominator of the function is $x^2 - 5x - 14$. Factoring this quadratic expression gives us $(x - 7)(x + 2)$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the values of $a$ and $b$ from the factored denominator.\nFrom the factored form of the denominator, we can see that the values of $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the equation $(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0$. This gives us $x = 7$ and $x = -2$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the horizontal asymptote.\nTo find the horizontal asymptote, we need to examine the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches infinity. We can do this by comparing the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nNow that we have found the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can calculate their sum. $a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

        "## Step 1: Write down the given information\nThe problem states that half the value of $3x-9$ is $x+37$.\n\n## Step 2: Translate the given information into an equation\nTo find the value of $x$, we need to translate the given information into an equation. We can do this by setting up an equation based on the given information.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation\nWe know that half the value of $3x-9$ is $x+37$. This can be written as:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(3x-9) = x+37$\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n$3x-9 = 2(x+37)$\n\n## Step 5: Distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation\nDistributing the 2 on the right side of the equation gives:\n\n$3x-9 = 2x+74$\n\n## Step 6: Get all the x terms on one side of the equation\nTo get all the x terms on one side of the equation, we can subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n$3x-2x-9 = 2x-2x+74$\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation gives:\n\n$x-9 = 74$\n\n## Step 8: Add 9 to both sides of the equation\nTo isolate x, we can add 9 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$x-9+9 = 74+9$\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation gives:\n\n$x = 83$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{83}$"

However, this is undefined because of division by zero. We need to consider the quadrant in which the point lies.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the correct value of $\\theta$\nSince the point $(0,3)$ lies in the first quadrant, we can use the properties of the arctangent function to find the correct value of $\\theta$.

We have $w = z \\cdot e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}} = (2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}).$\nStep 6:  Multiplying these complex numbers, we get $w = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{3 + 3 \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} - i\\frac{3 + 3 \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}.$\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we get $w = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2} - 3 - 3 \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2} - 3 - 3 \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}.$\nStep 8:  Further simplifying, we get $w = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}.$\nStep 9:  Therefore, the complex number $w$ that results from rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ counter-clockwise is $w = \\boxed{-1 - \\sqrt{2} - i - \\sqrt{2}i}.$",

Denali is responsible for 16 dogs and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs.

        "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the relevant concept\nTo find the constant term in the expansion of the given expression, we need to use the Binomial Theorem, which is a method for expanding expressions of the form $(a + b)^n$. The constant term arises when the powers of $x$ in the terms of the product cancel each other out.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Binomial Theorem\nAccording to the Binomial Theorem, the general term in the expansion of $(a + b)^n$ is given by $\\binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^r$, where $\\binom{n}{r}$ is the binomial coefficient. In this case, we have $a = 10x^3$, $b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}$, and $n = 5$. We are interested in finding the constant term, which occurs when the powers of $x$ in the terms of the product cancel each other out.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the values of r and n-r\nTo find the constant term, we need to determine the values of $r$ and $n-r$ such that the powers of $x$ cancel each other out. Since $a = 10x^3$ and $b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}$, we can see that the power of $x$ in $a$ is $3$ and the power of $x$ in $b$ is $-2$. To cancel out the power of $x$, we need to choose $r$ such that $3(5-r) - 2r = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for r\nSolving the equation $3(5-r) - 2r = 0$, we get $15 - 3r - 2r = 0$, which simplifies to $15 - 5r = 0$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = 3$. Therefore, we choose $r = 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the constant term\nNow that we have determined the value of $r$, we can calculate the constant term using the formula $\\binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^r$. Substituting $n = 5$, $r = 3$, $a = 10x^3$, and $b = -\\frac{1}{2x^2}$, we get $\\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} (-\\frac{1}{2x^2})^3$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get $\\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 (-\\frac{1}{2x^2})^3 = \\binom{5}{3} 100x^6 \\frac{-1}{8x^6} = \\binom{5}{3} \\frac{-100}{8}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the binomial coefficient\nEvaluating the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{3}$, we get $\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression further\nSubstituting the value of the binomial coefficient, we get $10 \\times \\frac{-100}{8} = 10 \\times -\\frac{100}{8} = 10 \\times -\\frac{25}{2} = -\\frac{250}{2} = -125$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-125}$",

        "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nWe are given that $\\sin A = 2\\cos A$ in right triangle $ABC$ with $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$. This implies that the ratio of the length of the side opposite angle $A$ to the length of the side adjacent to angle $A$ is twice the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to angle $A$ to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n## Step 2: Express $\\sin A$ and $\\cos A$ in terms of the sides of the triangle\nUsing the definitions of $\\sin A$ and $\\cos A$, we can express them in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let the side opposite angle $A$ be $a$, the side adjacent to angle $A$ be $b$, and the hypotenuse be $c$. Then, $\\sin A = \\frac{a}{c}$ and $\\cos A = \\frac{b}{c}$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $\\sin A$ and $\\cos A$ into the given equation\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sin A$ and $\\cos A$ into the given equation $\\sin A = 2\\cos A$, we get $\\frac{a}{c} = 2\\frac{b}{c}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nMultiplying both sides by $c$, we get $a = 2b$. Since $a$ is the side opposite angle $A$, we can express $a$ in terms of $b$ and $c$ as $a = 2b$. However, this is incorrect as the relationship between the sides of a right triangle should be expressed in terms of the sides adjacent and hypotenuse.\n\n## Step 5: Correct the relationship between the sides\nSince $a = 2b$ is incorrect, we should express the sides in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$ correctly. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $a = 2b$ into this equation, we get $(2b)^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Simplifying, we get $5b^2 = c^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Express $\\tan A$ in terms of the sides of the triangle\nUsing the definition of $\\tan A$, we can express it in terms of the sides of the triangle. $\\tan A = \\frac{a}{b}$. Substituting $a = 2b$ into this equation, we get $\\tan A = \\frac{2b}{b}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression for $\\tan A$\nSimplifying the expression for $\\tan A$, we have $\\tan A = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

Plugging these values into the formula, we get $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the roots of the quadratic equation $y^2 + y + 1 = 0$.\nWe can rewrite $\\sqrt{-3}$ as $i\\sqrt{3}$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit. Therefore, the roots of the equation are $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute back $y = z^2$ to get the roots of the original equation $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$.\nThe roots of the original equation are given by $z^2 = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Take the square root of both sides of the equation to solve for $z$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $z = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the roots in polar form to identify the roots of unity.\nThe roots can be expressed in polar form as $z = e^{\\pm \\frac{i\\pi}{3}}$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of the equation $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity.\nSince the roots of the equation are $e^{\\pm \\frac{i\\pi}{3}}$, the smallest positive integer $n$ is 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
        "## Step 1: Factor the denominator of the function to find the vertical asymptotes.\nTo find the vertical asymptotes, we need to factor the denominator of the function. The denominator of the function is $x^2 - 5x - 14$. Factoring this quadratic expression gives us $(x - 7)(x + 2)$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the values of $a$ and $b$ from the factored denominator.\nFrom the factored form of the denominator, we can see that the values of $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the equation $(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0$. This gives us $x = 7$ and $x = -2$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the horizontal asymptote.\nTo find the horizontal asymptote, we need to examine the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches infinity. We can do this by comparing the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nNow that we have found the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can calculate their sum. $a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
